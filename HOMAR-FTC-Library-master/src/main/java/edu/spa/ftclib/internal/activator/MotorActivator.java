 * Use this if you have a motor that you normally only turn on and off (e.g. part of an intake mechanism).
 * It will store the power you want to send to the motor when it is on, and then you can call setActivated(true) and setActivated(false) to automatically activate and deactivate the motor.
 * The motor is public, so if you ever need to set it to run at a different power or change a setting you can do that.
 * Continuous rotation servos count as motors (DcMotorSimple is implemented by both DcMotor and CRServo).
